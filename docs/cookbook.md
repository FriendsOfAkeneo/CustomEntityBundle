# Custom Entity Bundle

Please know that you will have to clear the Symfony cache (`bin/console --env=prod cache:clear`) each time you update a configuration file. You have to rebuild front assets (`yarn run webpack-dev`) and web browser cache too each time you update a routing file, a translation file or any other front related file. 

## Create the reference data

In order to create your entity, you have to create a class that extends AbstractCustomEntity. In this cookbook, we will create an entity called Supplier with only one property `name`.

AbstractCustomEntity already declares 2 mandatory properties: `code` and `id`, so you just have to add your entity specific properties.

```php
<?php

namespace Acme\Bundle\AppBundle\Entity;

use Pim\Bundle\CustomEntityBundle\Entity\AbstractCustomEntity;

class Supplier extends AbstractCustomEntity
{
    protected $name;
    
    public function getName(): string
    {
        return $this->name;
    }

    public function setName($name): void
    {
        $this->name = $name;
    }
}
```

**Note**: If your reference entity is made up of 2 words (eg. `SuperHero`), be sure to override this method in your file:
```php
/**
 * Returns the custom entity name used in the configuration
 * Used to map row actions on datagrid
 *
 * @return string
 */
public function getCustomEntityName(): string
{
    return 'superHero';
}
```

Then, create the doctrine mapping for this entity to declare the entity fields and table name where the entity will be persisted.

```yaml
#Acme\Bundle\SupplierBundle\Resources\config\doctrine\Supplier.orm.yml
Acme\Bundle\SupplierBundle\Entity\Supplier:
    type: entity
    table: refdata_supplier
    changeTrackingPolicy: DEFERRED_EXPLICIT
    repositoryClass: Pim\Bundle\CustomEntityBundle\Entity\Repository\CustomEntityRepository
    fields:
        id:
            type: integer
            id: true
            generator:
                strategy: AUTO
        code:
            type: string
            length: 255
            nullable: false
            unique: true
        name:
            type: string
            length: 255
            nullable: false
```

## Update the database

Each new reference data is persisted in a dedicated table. You can see what will be the create table SQL query by executing this command:
```bash
bin/console doctrine:schema:update --dump-sql
```
If you're fine with the SQL query, you can run it by replacing the `--dump-sql` option by `--force` to create the table in the database.

You can check that the table is correctly created in your database.
 
## Your reference data as an attribute

Follow the online documentation : https://docs.akeneo.com/2.0/manipulate_pim_data/catalog_structure/creating_a_reference_data.html#configuring-the-reference-data

At this point, the reference data can already be used as an attribute in your families. Try to create a new "reference data simple select" attribute.

## Reference data CRUD

### Menu
A new menu item can be added to access the reference data list. To achieve that, declare the menu item by creating a new configuration file:
```yaml
#Acme\Bundle/SupplierBundle/Resources/config/form_extensions/menu.yml
extensions:
    acme-menu-supplier:
        module: pim/menu/item
        parent: pim-menu-reference_data-navigation-block
        position: 10
        config:
            title: acme.menu.item.reference_data.supplier
            to: pim_customentity_index
            routeParams:
                customEntityName: supplier
```
At this point the item menu should be visible at the end of the menu.

### Datagrid configuration

Create a new configuration file to declare the datagrid configuration for supplier. First, declare the source and columns configuration just to have a basic list page: 

```yaml
#Acme/Bundle/SupplierBundle/Resources/config/datagrid/supplier.yml
datagrid:
    supplier:
        options:
            entityHint: supplier
            manageFilters: false
        source:
            type: pim_datasource_default
            entity: Acme\Bundle\SupplierBundle\Entity\Supplier
            repository_method: createDatagridQueryBuilder
        columns:
            code:
                label: acme.supplier.field.code
            name:
                label: acme.supplier.field.name
```

And declare your new custom entity:
```yaml
#Acme/Bundle/SupplierBundle/Resources/config/custom_entities.yml
custom_entities:
    supplier:
        entity_class: Acme\Bundle\SupplierBundle\Entity\Supplier
```

#### Form extension

Declare the reference data index page form extension. You can find an exemple of working configuration [here](https://github.com/akeneo-labs/CustomEntityBundle/blob/master/docs/examples/CustomBundle/Resources/config/form_extensions/brand/index.yml). You should comment the create button part, we'll add it later in this cookbook.

At this point, you should have a basic empty list of reference data, with no possibility to add a new supplier or filter the list for now.

#### Add the creation form

The list page is now ready to display some content. Let's add the creation form to be able to create new reference data. You can find a working example [here](https://github.com/akeneo-labs/CustomEntityBundle/blob/master/docs/examples/CustomBundle/Resources/config/form_extensions/brand/create.yml). 

Declare the create button in your index.yml form extension file to be able to display the create form.

Once the configuration file is complete, try to create a new reference data. You should have an error, because once the creation is done, you are redirected to the edit form which do not exists yet. But if you go back to the list, your new reference data should be here.

Try to create 2 or 3 reference data, it will be useful for the next part.

#### Add filters on the list:

We can make the list filterable by adding the following configuration:

```yaml
#Acme/Bundle/SupplierBundle/Resources/config/datagrid/supplier.yml
datagrid:
    supplier:
        #[...]
        filters:
            columns:
                code:
                    type: string
                    label: acme.supplier.field.code
                    data_name: rd.code
                name:
                    type: search
                    label: acme.supplier.field.name
                    data_name: rd.name
```

Clear Symfony cache and rebuild your assets and uou should now see a new text field to filter the list, try it to ensure the filtering is working.

#### Make the list sortable:

Then we can make the list sortable, with the following code:

```yaml
#Acme/Bundle/SupplierBundle/Resources/config/datagrid/supplier.yml
datagrid:
    supplier:
        #[...]
        sorters:
            columns:
                code:
                    data_name: rd.code
                name:
                    data_name: rd.name
            default:
                code: '%oro_datagrid.extension.orm_sorter.class%::DIRECTION_ASC'
```

The column headers should now be clickable to sort the results.

#### Add the edition form

You can find a working example [here](https://github.com/akeneo-labs/CustomEntityBundle/blob/master/docs/examples/CustomBundle/Resources/config/form_extensions/brand/edit.yml).

If you try to click on a reference data to edit it, you'll see it doesn't work. It's because the edit link is not configured for the datagrid. Add the following configuration to declare the route and the edit button:

```yaml
#Acme/Bundle/SupplierBundle/Resources/config/datagrid/supplier.yml
datagrid:
    supplier:
        #[...]
        properties:
            id: ~
            edit_link:
                type: url
                route: pim_customentity_rest_get
                params:
                    - id
                    - customEntityName
        actions:
            edit:
                type:      navigate
                label:     acme.supplier.this.edit
                icon:      edit
                link:      edit_link
                rowAction: true
```

And add the following configuration to link the entity to its edition form:
```yaml
#Acme/Bundle/SupplierBundle/Resources/config/custom_entities.yml
custom_entities:
    supplier:
        options:
            edit_form_extension: acme-supplier-edit-form
```

At this point, you should be able to display the edition form. But you should also see that all the fields are empty except the code. It’s because the entity has no normalizer, so we need to write one:

```php
<?php

namespace Acme\Bundle\SupplierBundle\Normalizer;

use Symfony\Component\Serializer\Normalizer\NormalizerInterface;
use Symfony\Component\Serializer\Normalizer\scalar;
use Acme\Bundle\SupplierBundle\Entity\Supplier;

class SupplierNormalizer implements NormalizerInterface
{
    public function normalize($object, $format = null, array $context = array())
    {
        return [
            'id' => $object->getId(),
            'code' => $object->getCode(),
            'name' => $object->getName(),
        ];
    }

    public function supportsNormalization($data, $format = null)
    {
        return $data instanceof Supplier;
    }
}
```

The `normalize` method must return an array containing the reference data properties, with the property names as array keys and the property values as array values.

Now declare the normalizer as a service:

```yaml
#Acme/Bundle/SupplierBundle/Resources/config/services.yml
services:
    acme.normalizer.supplier:
        class: Acme\Bundle\SupplierBundle\Normalizer\SupplierNormalizer
        tags:
            - {name: pim_serializer.normalizer, priority: 200}
```

The service must be tagged as “pim_serializer.normalizer” to be registered in the serializer. You now have to load the services.yml file via the dependency injection.

At this point, you should be able to see all the fields of your reference data. If you click on the save button, the reference data should be saved and the list should also display the updated informations.

#### Add the deletion action

Same as the edition form, we need to declare the delete route and button

```yaml
#Acme/Bundle/SupplierBundle/Resources/config/datagrid/supplier.yml
datagrid:
    supplier:
        #[...]
        actions:
            delete:
                type: delete
                label: acme.supplier.this.delete
                icon: trash
                link: delete_link
```
```yaml
#Acme/Bundle/SupplierBundle/Resources/config/datagrid/supplier.yml
datagrid:
    supplier:
        #[...]
        properties:
            delete_link:
                type: url
                route: pim_customentity_rest_delete
                params:
                    - id
                    - customEntityName
```
You should now be able to delete any reference data by clicking the delete icon on the list.

At this point, the datagrid configuration is fully working, and you should be able to list, edit or delete any reference data value.

## Internationalization

You have to create 2 translation files. The file `messages.en.yml` is used by the Symfony translator in the backend, while the `jsmessages.en.yml` is for all the front translations. Here is an example for english:

```yaml
#acme/Bundle/SupplierBundle/Resources/translations/messages.en.yml

acme:
    supplier:
        field:
            name: Name
            code: Code
```

```yaml
#acme/Bundle/SupplierBundle/Resources/translations/jsmessages.en.yml

acme.menu.item.reference_data.supplier: Supplier
acme:
    supplier:
        field:
            name: Name
            code: Code
        index_title: Supplier overview
        section:
            code: Identifier
            other: General information
        messages:
            created.success: The supplier has been successfully created
            remove:
                confirm: Are you sure you want to remove this supplier?
                success: The supplier has been successfully removed
                fail: The supplier has not been removed
            edit:
                success: The supplier has been successfully updated
                fail: The supplier has not been updated
        this:
            edit: Edit this supplier
            show: Show this supplier
            delete: Delete this supplier

flash.supplier.removed: The supplier has been successfully removed
confirmation.remove.supplier: Are you sure you want to remove this supplier?
```
