## Disclaimer

The 2.0.0 custom entity bundle is in bÃªta state because of missing features:
- mass edit
- quick export
- mass delete
- missing translations
- outdated documentation

Work is in progress and we will release a stable version very soon.

## Installation
You can install this bundle with composer (see requirements section):

```bash
    php composer.phar require akeneo-labs/custom-entity-bundle:2.0.0@beta
```

Then add the following lines **at the end** of your app/config/routing.yml :

```yaml
    pim_customentity:
        prefix: /reference-data
        resource: "@PimCustomEntityBundle/Resources/config/routing.yml"
```

and enable the bundle in the `app/AppKernel.php` file in the `registerBundles()` method:

```php
    $bundles = [
        // ...
        new Pim\Bundle\CustomEntityBundle\PimCustomEntityBundle(),
    ]
```

If you want to use the quick export and/or the mass edit features, you have to load the job fixture defined in
[Resources/fixtures/jobs.yml](Resources/fixtures/jobs.yml) file and to copy/paste its content to your installer.

If your installation is already set up, you have to run the following command:

```bash
    php bin/console akeneo:batch:create-job "Akeneo Mass Edit Connector" "csv_reference_data_quick_export" "quick_export" "csv_reference_data_quick_export" '{"delimiter": ";", "enclosure": "\"", "withHeader": true, "filePath": "/tmp/reference_data_quick_export.csv"}'
```

## Documentation

The reference data documentation can befound in the 
[PIM documentation](https://docs.akeneo.com/2.0/manipulate_pim_data/catalog_structure/creating_a_reference_data.html#how-to-create-a-reference-data).
For newer versions, you have to use reference datas in Akeneo PIM (http://docs.akeneo.com/latest/cookbook/catalog_structure/creating_a_reference_data.html).

The custom entity bundle provides the following tools to help managing custom entities inside the Akeneo PIM.

* [Abstract entities and repositories](docs/abstract_entities_and_repositories.rst)
* [CRUD interface](docs/crud_interface.rst)
* [CRUD managers](docs/crud_managers.rst)

A demo project has been created [here](docs/examples/Acme) to give more examples about what we can do.
It can easily installed using [this setup script](docs/examples/bin/setup_example.bash).
